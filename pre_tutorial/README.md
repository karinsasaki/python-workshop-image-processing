## README Pre-Tutorial on Image Processing and Analysis with Python


### DESCRIPTION
Here you can find a tutorial that introduces basic, but necessary, concept of digital images and their manipulation with Python. It also has a short tutorial on the Python library NumPy and another on Python functions.

This course assumes a basic knowledge of the Python Programming Language.


### REQUIREMENTS
- Python 2.7 (we recommend the Anaconda distribution, which includes most of the required modules)
- Modules: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, tifffile
- A text/code editor 


### PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS AND CONTENT DISCUSSED IN THIS TUTORIAL
- The Python NumPy library to manipulate images
- Making functions in Python
- Manipulating images with Python


### IMAGE PROCESSING CONCEPTS AND CONTENT DISCUSSED IN THIS TUTORIAL
- The numerical and array nature of digital images
- Bit-depth, variable types and data types of images in Python
- Grayness resolution, RGB format and look up tables
- Image arithmetic and unexpected errors due to data type



### HOW TO FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL
- Files you should have: ipython notebooks titled pre-tutorial, arrays-and-numpy and tutorial-on-functions.
- To start the ipython notebooks, start a new terminal window and type “jupyter notebook”, then press enter. When a new browser window opens, navigate to the folder where you have saved the tutorials. Click on the tutorial that you want to follow.  
- Using Jupyter notebook: When you want to type code into a cell, simply click on it to activate it. When you want to run the code, press shift+enter. You can learn how to use Jupyter notebooks from, e.g., https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- The tutorial is self explanatory, indicating the steps to be taken next, what you should aim at achieving after carrying out those steps and the commands that could be used (there is not a one correct answer; these are suggestions).
- With this exercise we want to encourage you to become a more independent programmer, so if there is a command you don't quite know how to use, make sure you read the documentation. To do so, most of the time is enough to google the words 'documentation, python' and the name of the module or function you want to use.
- If you are following this tutorial in class, if you have any questions, raise your hand and someone will come to help you. Otherwise, feel free to send your query to one of these two email addresses:
